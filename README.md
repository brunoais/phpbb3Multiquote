phpbb3Multiquote
================

A multiquote system for the interface of phpbb3. This is meant for discussion and collaboration. The final version is that one that will be delivered to phpbb3.1

The main branch is the gh-pages branch. The reason behind that is to have always (and easily) the most recent version without the need of duplicates.
